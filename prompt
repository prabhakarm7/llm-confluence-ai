                              relevant context for a chunk of text based on the 
                              following research paper.

                              Here is the research paper:
                              <paper>
                              {paper}

                              Here is the chunk we want to situate within the whole 
                              document:

                              chunk, considering the following guidelines:

                              - Give a short succinct context to situate this chunk 
                                within the overall document for the purposes of  
                                improving search retrieval of the chunk.
                              - Answer only with the succinct context and nothing 
                                else.
                              - Context should be mentioned like 'Focuses on ....'
                                do not mention 'this chunk or section focuses on...'
