# Spark 007 - Mission Optimization Protocol

# Architecture Overview

# 1. Agent Spark 007 (Core Engine)
# - Parses PySpark code
# - Generates DAG from transformations/actions
# - Identifies shuffle, wide/narrow transformations, UDFs, loops

# 2. Agent Q (Optimization Rule Engine)
# - Applies 50+ best practices for Spark code
# - Checks join types, caching, file formats, API use, predicate pushdown
# - Highlights tasks as High I/O, CPU, Shuffle

# 3. Agent M (Cost Intelligence Officer)
# - Accepts dataset size, schema
# - Estimates execution time and memory requirements
# - Maps task complexity to cost using heuristics

# 4. Agent ClusterMind (Cluster Tuner)
# - Suggests ideal Spark config: executor memory, node type, shuffle partitions
# - Validates against estimated data and DAG complexity

# 5. Moneypenny Console (UI)
# - React + MUI interface
# - Input: Code upload or paste, dataset info, cluster profile
# - Outputs: DAG visual, cost report, optimization suggestions

# ---
# FastAPI Backend (Python)
# /analyze-code:
#     - Input: Code, dataset info, schema
#     - Output: DAG structure (JSON), optimization report, cost breakdown
# /generate-dag:
#     - Returns visual DAG info
# /suggest-cluster:
#     - Input: DAG + estimated size
#     - Output: Config recommendations

# React Frontend (MUI Theme)
# - Left Panel: Code Input, Dataset Info, Cluster Config
# - Right Panel: Tabs - [DAG Visual | Optimization Report | Cluster Suggestion]
# - Color legend: Red (High Shuffle), Yellow (Skew Detected), Green (Optimized)

# -- Next Steps --
# [1] Generate detailed FastAPI endpoint scaffolding
# [2] Design React UI layout using MUI Tabs
# [3] Implement DAG parser & skew detection
# [4] Apply optimization rule engine with severity tags
# [5] Wire frontend/backend for real-time results
